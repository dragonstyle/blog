I just put together a simple, but ho pefully useful, extension that will allow you to embed social posts within your Quarto document using a shortcode. It includes support for HTML, LaTeX, and fallback output formats, though the HTML output is really the main point.

Here's a simple example, using the shortcode:

```markdown
{{{< share-post https://mstdn.social/@ramikrispin/111697864037291257 >}}}
```

which results in a nice embedded preview, such as:

{{< share-post https://mstdn.social/@ramikrispin/111697864037291257 >}}

It currently supports Mastodon, Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads, Instagram, and Pinterest. It's usually easy to add more, so feel free to [request improvements](https://github.com/dragonstyle/share-post)!

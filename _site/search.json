The largest issue for me was the fact that I didn’t know any shortcut keys, so I was using the mouse a lot more than I’m used to. I’m overcoming that, though I desparately miss ctrl+tab to switch between windows of the current application.\nThere are two applications that I haven’t been able to give up in my transition, however.\n\n\n\n“Application #1 is Zune. Yeah, I said it. I’m not being a MS fanboy- Zune is a truly great application (the interface is far superior to iTunes, really not even comparable), but it also has subscription music, which is a huge money saver for me (I waste a lot less money buying music that I end up getting sick of or not liking at all). So enjoy the rich irony of Zune running on my MacBook Pro, and my horrible brown Zune docked to the awesomely great looking laptop.”\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe second application is, of course, Windows Live Writer. I actually spent the first week or so on the Mac without installing Writer, and it was just too painful. Trying to use the web interface was a complete non starter, and there was simply no comparison between other editors out there (ok, now I’m being biased). A quick VMWare and Windows XP install later and I’m running Writer on my Mac, using Unity to create a first class experience.\n\n\nThe transition was really smoothed by the addition of VMware- anytime I need to I can simply open up Windows and do what I need to do (I ended up installing Visual Studio there so I can whip up quick utility apps in C#, for example). to any windows users getting ready to make the jump, I can definitely give you two pieces of advice from my experience:\nThe Mac experience is sweet. The OS is nice, the hardware and software are beautiful, and everything does really just work. I’d recommend it. Invest in VMWare Fusion. For the small additional cost of of a VMware license, you can keep your Windows apps around, and have a fall back plan in case you need to do something that just requires Windows."

    "text": "Everyone who has spent some time on the App Store realizes that there are a large number of pointless or even harmful comments. Whether the post simply says ‘first’, disses an application that the commenter has never used, or complains about an issue that was fixed in an updated version of the app, the comment system on the App Store isn’t adequate. It’s a rough situation since the App Store doesn’t allow trialing of apps. Comments, the application description, and the application screenshots are the only real way for an end user to assess an application, so filling 1/3 of the assessment with garbage really hurts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome see this as a place where Apple should exert more control, perhaps even filtering the comments. What grand irony that the same people that complain when Apple filter apps call for Apple to filter comments! Here’s a couple of suggestions that would go a long ways to improving the commenting, but don’t require Apple to be a gatekeeper.\n\nAllow users to rate comments. Comments that are pointless and crappy will simply be voted down (a la Slashdot, Digg, Reddit, Amazon.com reviews, and a million other examples). Use filtering to only display the low rated comments if the viewer requests it.\n\nEdit: Hey- they already allow this, and it looks to be working pretty well. Some of the apps I looked at had pretty reasonable reviews with very little noise, just from this filter alone. Nice.\n\nAllow a single developer post to appear at or near the top of the comments. This developer post can be updated when the developer publishes a new version of their product. They can use it to explain what issues (that appear in the comments) they have addressed in the current release. A lot of developers are doing this in the application description, and it’s annoying to see a bunch of text responding to comments where there should just be text describing the application.\nFilter on whether the commenter has ‘bought’ the app. Since iTunes knows what Apps the user has, why not just add a simple icon to comments from folks who have actually downloaded the app, and default a filter to only show comments by people who have downloaded the app. This adds friction to the pointless commenters and will help improve the quality of comments that display.\n\nWhatever happens, how about we trend away from gatekeepers in the App Store?"

    "text": "One of the challenges that has faced developers of apps on the iTunes App Store has been how to price their applications. Early customers complained about applications with high (read: more than $9.99) prices. Since those early days, a competitive and crowded field of applications has conspired to push prices down as consumers faced more choices and application sought to claim a stop on the coveted ‘Top 25’ list.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple really made things a challenge, largely because they have such a limited business model for these applications (a 1 time license fee, no subscription model, no charged upgrade model, no trial model). Developer’s hands were really tied.\nA smart developer would be better served to build a large number of small inexpensive applications (collecting revenue from customers each time they release a new application) rather than spend a large amount of time on complicated apps. After all, a lots of users will plunk down $1.99 for an app based only on screen shots and reviews, but most are loathe to part with $29.99 on just the promise of a good app.\nSo it came to be that the app store has been crowded, at least in my opinion, with a ton of apps that are a lot closer to gadgets than applications. Useful, sure. Valuable, maybe. An inspired use of what is an excellent mobile computing platform? Definitely not.\nBut just today, I’ve seen a couple of apps that are bucking the trend.\nBeeJiveIM is a deep IM client for the iPhone that supports pretty much every IM platform out there. It uses push email to do notification of new messages. It has a broad and deep feature set. And, it costs $15.99. Jaadu VNC is a VNC client which allows you to connect to and control your desktop computer (whether that is a Mac or PC). Broad and deep feature set. $24.99. Now, we just to need to wait and see how the economics play out. Can these more complicated and expensive applications thrive at a high price, in a market with so many limitations? Will Apple continue to invest in improving iTunes for applications, adding some of the basic business models that software companies have traditionally used in selling their software?\nIf you’re wondering why I’d like to see expensive iPhone applications, the answer is pretty simple. It’s because I’d like to see awesome, compelling, deep, feature rich, and evolving applications the iPhone. And I’d like to see the developers who build getting paid a fair price."

The graph below illustrates the growth of various price points, and $.99 is outpacing every other price, including free. Seems everyone thinks they can make a buck on the App Store (well, 70 cents).\n\nOf course, one of the very interesting things about settling on $.99 is the fact that this is also the base unit of measure in the rest of iTunes, where songs cost $.99. Are we trending toward a store that sells primarily applications in the same way it sells songs? And if so, what does that imply about how applications will look, how complex they will be, and their longevity? After all, the music business is largely a hits business (at least it used to be, now who knows what kind of business it is). And I guess the app business is likely to look the same…"

Each day, iPhone users can choose among 15 new games, 7 new utilities, 9 new entertainment applications, or 3 new productivity applications. 73 new applications appear in the App Store every day.\nWant to track your finances? Mint.com.

They’re still working on catching the iPhone as far as its integration and slick user experience. The fact that the App Store is continuing to grow at such a torrid pace is bad news for these competitors. Because each new application is a potential reason for a customer to choose the iPhone and each new customer is a reason for a developer to build an application for the iPhone. This virtuous circle is creating tremendous advantage for the iPhone- it’ll make it incredibly difficult to catch Apple, once again.\nIf you’re interested in doing some analysis yourself, here is my latest raw data (csv)."

    "text": "If you’re looking for market feedback on the value of applications, here it is. Using updated data to take a look a pricing trends confirms what I think everyone already knows. Each month, the average price of apps on the store just declines. For example, have a look at the average price of applications (excluding medical applications, whose high prices skew the results).\n\n\n\n\n\nAn average application price that was once nearly $4 has fallen to nearly $2.25. It’s too early to tell, but it certainly doesn’t look like we’ve hit bottom yet, either.\n\nGames\nIf you look at games, the downward trend is much more dramatic, but prices appear to have stabilized at just under 2 bucks an application. This, of course, begs the question- games are the most popular application in the store, is this because they’re cheap? Or is this really the best we can hope for- that the most popular category of applications on the store is perceived as being worth about $1.50 an application?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Fitness\nHealth and Fitness is one of the few categories that appears to be reversing this trend. After an initial price drop, this category has seen average prices rise nearly every month, now approaching $3 an application. And it does make sense- after all health and fitness applications are likely to impact your life much more significantly than a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Are Prices Headed Down?\nWhy the downward trend overall? There are a lot of factors.\n\nBuyers of consumer mobile applications were already used to paying $5-7 for applications. This set a relatively low ceiling for applications targeted at consumers (who are the main buyer of iPhones).\nThe inability to trial software means that users have to take a risk that they don’t like the software. This risk has to be priced into the software, reducing the price that can be charged.\nThe large number of relatively simplistic and useless applications on the store increase the perceived risk when purchasing software. This increased risk of disappointment forces prices down further. \nOf course for many applications (lighters, flashlights, geiger counters) there are large number of substitute goods. This drives prices down. (And while we’re on the subject, do these developers call each other in the morning and decide which sort of annoying application they’re going to build today? How is it that 5 geiger counter applications manage to show up on the same day?!)\n\n\n\nThere is No End in Site\nBut the real problem here isn’t that customers like cheap applications. It’s that the way the store is structured today is creating a vicious circle of downward spiraling prices. As pricing pressure forces applications to be less expensive, developers need to respond by reducing their investment in the applications (to make them profitable). This in turn reduces the value of the applications, continuing to increase price pressure. Without some kind of change, I’m not sure where the pricing stops. \nA couple of suggestions\n\nLet developers get recurring revenue by charging for upgrades or selling subscriptions. This breaks the cycle by allowing developers to profit from further investment, leaving initial prices low, but increasing revenue from satisfied users who continue to use the application.\nGrow the user base fast enough that some companies can be profitable even selling something for $.99. Of course, when the price pressure forces the price below $.99, then what? \n\nOr maybe, this is by design. After all, Apple stands to make 30% of the total app sales, and they don’t need to applications to be expensive. In fact, when you consider that they make money on the app transaction, but also that each new application adds value to the iPhone platform, more apps (even if they’re cheap) is probably better for Apple."

This follows the vitamin versus pain killer theory- people pay more for pain killers than for vitamins.\n\nA related point to consider- free applications are a lot more popular than paid applications. Since we don’t know how the popularity score is calculated, it’s a bit difficult to figure out what to make of this, other than to point out the obvious- people are willing to try free stuff."

    "text": "Distribution\nIn a previous posts I analyzed the 100 most popular applications (at the time). One of the takeaways from that analysis was that games dominated the top application lists. If you needed more evidence that games are the runaway success of the store, here it is. Games represent 23% of the applications available on the store, but make up between 39 and 50% of the positions on the list of top applications.\n\n\nMost Popular Applications (Any Category, Any Price)\nThe App Store data about each application contains a field with a popularity score (this is the field that is used to show the popularity bar graphs next to songs and other content in the store). Applications, include that data as well, with values ranging from 0 to 1. When I researched how that value is populated, Apple’s official position is that it is a combination of sales and other Apple internal calculations. Well, according to the popularity score, here are the most popular applications in the App Store. All are free.\n\n\n\nName\nPrice\nPopularity\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Mobile App\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\nShazam\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\nUrbanspoon\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\nBackgrounds\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\n160000 Recipes - BigOven\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\nCube\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\nThe Weather ChannelÂ®\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\nFacebook\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\nTouch Hockey: FS5 (FREE)\n$0.00 \n1.000000000000\n\n\nGoogle Earth\n$0.00 \n0.886920900000\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Paid Applications\nUsing the same popularity score, here are the more popular paid applications in the store.

No idea whether anyone is making serious money, though. \nPeople are trying to sell serious applications on the App Store, charging hundreds of dollars for high value applications and data.

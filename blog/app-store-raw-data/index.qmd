For those that are interested, [here is recent (well actually, today's) CSV file](applications.csv) with the raw data that I've been using to look more closely at the App Store. Feel free to use it for good.

If you do decide to blog about something interesting that you've found in analyzing the data, it would be great if you could give me a little shout out/link and also if you could let me know so I can benefit from what you've learned!

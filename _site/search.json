Little did I know that he had actually weighed in on what it takes to do great scientific writing. He did!\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe what he outlines are tips for good writing (not just good scientific writing). A few highlights:\n\nKeep sentences short, simply constructed and direct. Concise, clear sentences work well for scientific explanations. Minimize clauses, compound sentences and transition words ‚Äî such as ‚Äòhowever‚Äô or ‚Äòthus‚Äô ‚Äî so that the reader can focus on the main message.\nDon‚Äôt over-elaborate. Only use an adjective if it‚Äôs relevant. Your paper is not a dialogue with the readers‚Äô potential questions, so don‚Äôt go overboard anticipating them. Don‚Äôt say the same thing in three different ways in any single section. Don‚Äôt say both ‚Äòelucidate‚Äô and ‚Äòelaborate‚Äô. Just choose one, or you risk that your readers will give up.\nDashes should emphasize the clauses you consider most important ‚Äî without using bold or italics ‚Äî and not only for defining terms.\nFinally, try to write the best version of your paper: the one that you like. You can‚Äôt please an anonymous reader, but you should be able to please yourself. Your paper ‚Äî you hope ‚Äî is for posterity. Remember how you first read the papers that inspired you while you enjoy the process of writing your own.\n\nRead: Novelist Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs tips on how to write a great science paper"

    "text": "If you‚Äôre looking for market feedback on the value of applications, here it is. Using updated data to take a look a pricing trends confirms what I think everyone already knows. Each month, the average price of apps on the store just declines. For example, have a look at the average price of applications (excluding medical applications, whose high prices skew the results).\n\n\n\n\n\nAn average application price that was once nearly $4 has fallen to nearly $2.25. It‚Äôs too early to tell, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt look like we‚Äôve hit bottom yet, either.\n\nGames\nIf you look at games, the downward trend is much more dramatic, but prices appear to have stabilized at just under 2 bucks an application. This, of course, begs the question-¬†games are the most popular application in the store, is this because they‚Äôre cheap? Or is this really the best we can hope for- that the most popular category of applications on the store is perceived as being worth about $1.50 an application?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Fitness\nHealth and Fitness is one of the few categories that appears to be reversing this trend. After an initial price drop, this category has seen average prices rise nearly every month, now approaching $3 an application. And it does make sense- after all health and fitness applications are likely to impact your life much more significantly than a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Are Prices Headed Down?\nWhy the downward trend overall? There are a lot of factors.\n\nBuyers of consumer mobile applications were already used to paying $5-7 for applications. This set a relatively low ceiling for applications targeted at consumers (who are the main buyer of iPhones).\nThe inability to trial software means that users have to take a risk that they don‚Äôt like the software. This risk has to be priced into the software, reducing the price that can be charged.\nThe large number of relatively simplistic and useless applications on the store increase the perceived risk when purchasing software. This increased risk of disappointment forces prices down further.¬†\nOf course for many applications (lighters, flashlights, geiger counters) there are large number of substitute goods. This drives prices down. (And while we‚Äôre on the subject, do these developers call each other in the morning and decide which sort of annoying application they‚Äôre going to build today? How is it that 5 geiger counter applications manage to show up on the same day?!)\n\n\n\nThere is No End in Site\nBut the real problem here isn‚Äôt that customers like cheap applications. It‚Äôs that the way the store is structured today is creating a¬†vicious circle¬†of downward spiraling prices. As pricing pressure forces applications to be less expensive, developers need to respond by reducing their investment in the applications (to make them profitable). This in turn reduces the value of the applications, continuing to increase price pressure. Without some kind of change, I‚Äôm not sure where the pricing stops.¬†\nA couple of suggestions\n\nLet developers get recurring revenue by charging for upgrades or selling subscriptions. This breaks the cycle by allowing developers to profit from further investment, leaving initial prices low, but increasing revenue from satisfied users who continue to use the application.\nGrow the user base fast enough that some companies can be profitable even selling something for $.99. Of course, when the price pressure forces the price below $.99, then what?¬†\n\nOr maybe, this is by design. After all, Apple stands to make 30% of the total app sales, and they don‚Äôt need to applications to be expensive. In fact, when you consider that they make money on the app transaction, but also that each new application adds value to the iPhone platform, more apps (even if they‚Äôre cheap) is probably better for Apple."

    "text": "Prompted by Nate‚Äôs comment, here are a couple more looks at application trends on the app Store. First, if you have a look at the distribution of applications by price over time, you can see the rise of $.99 and $1.99 apps, along with the corresponding fall in free applications. Applications priced $4.99-$9.99 also see a decline, while most other prices are essentially stable.\n\nInterestingly, with just a couple of exceptions, the distribution of categories appears to be stabilizing a bit, at least for the top genres. Games represent about a quarter of the applications in the store. The big mover appears to be medical, which has grown to more than 5% of the apps in the store.\n\nAnd in a final note- the growth of the apps in the store continues to be steep- closing on 12,000 applications‚Ä¶"

There really is an app for that.\nThere are now more than 17,000 applications available in the App Store. 17,706 to be precise. Each day, iPhone users can choose among 15 new games, 7 new utilities, 9 new entertainment applications, or 3 new productivity applications. 73 new applications appear in the App Store every day.\nWant to track your finances?¬†Mint.com.

The fact that the App Store is continuing to grow at such a torrid pace is bad news for these competitors. Because each new application is a potential reason for a customer to choose the iPhone and each new customer is a reason for a developer to build an application for the iPhone. This virtuous circle is creating tremendous advantage for the iPhone- it‚Äôll make it incredibly difficult to catch Apple, once again.\nIf you‚Äôre interested in doing some analysis yourself,¬†here is my latest raw data (csv)."

The graph below illustrates the growth of various price points, and $.99 is outpacing every other price, including free. Seems everyone thinks they can make a buck on the App Store (well, 70 cents).\n\nOf course, one of the very interesting things about settling on $.99 is the fact that this is also the base unit of measure in the rest of iTunes, where songs cost $.99. Are we trending toward a store that sells primarily applications in the same way it sells songs? And if so, what does that imply about how applications will look, how complex they will be, and their longevity? After all, the music business is largely a hits business (at least it used to be, now who knows what kind of business it is). And I guess the app business is likely to look the same‚Ä¶"

The popularity score appears to be related to the category, so you can‚Äôt effectively compare applications across categories. This makes it tough to do things like rank categories.\nAs I was playing around with the data, however, I thought I‚Äôd try to rank the categories by creating a score for the category based upon the simply sum of the popularity of the top 25 most popular applications in each category. My theory is simply that even though you can‚Äôt compare across categories, you can see what categories are popular based upon the total (or average) of the most popular applications. The results aren‚Äôt that surprising‚Äî games and entertainment are overwhelmingly more popular than other categories.\nBut way to go Finance- cracking the top 5!\n\n\n\nGenre\nTop 25 Popularity\n\n\n\n\nGames\n12.57416165\n\n\nEntertainment\n10.00990161\n\n\nUtilities\n5.601598622\n\n\nFinance\n4.76452379\n\n\nPhotography\n3.976679545\n\n\nMusic\n3.936911809\n\n\nSocial Networking\n3.791524468\n\n\nHealth and Fitness\n3.761630667\n\n\nLifestyle\n3.74729853\n\n\nNews\n3.500520549\n\n\nSports\n3.416063511\n\n\nMedical\n3.376850336\n\n\nReference\n2.890492635\n\n\nProductivity\n2.622859642\n\n\nTravel\n2.526778971\n\n\nBooks\n1.548586185\n\n\nWeather\n1.472607508\n\n\nBusiness\n1.275677389\n\n\nNavigation\n1.223784489\n\n\nEducation\n0.779896454\n\n\n\n\nCategory Concentration\nOne other category related question that I‚Äôve spent some time thinking about is the concentration of applications in a category- specifically whether some categories are dominated by highly popular applications while others have a larger number of moderately popular applications. To get a sense for this- I used the above ‚ÄòTop 25 Popularity‚Äô score and calculated what percentage of a category‚Äôs total popularity is accounted for by the top applications. Here are the results:\n\n\n\nGenre\nConcentration\n\n\n\n\nWeather\n96%\n\n\nNews\n90%\n\n\nReference\n85%\n\n\nTravel\n84%\n\n\nSocial Networking\n83%\n\n\nSports\n78%\n\n\nHealth and Fitness\n75%\n\n\nFinance\n75%\n\n\nMedical\n73%\n\n\nNavigation\n72%\n\n\nMusic\n70%\n\n\nPhotography\n69%\n\n\nLifestyle\n65%\n\n\nBooks\n64%\n\n\nProductivity\n62%\n\n\nBusiness\n61%\n\n\nUtilities\n58%\n\n\nEducation\n51%\n\n\nEntertainment\n50%\n\n\nGames\n34%\n\n\n\nGames and Entertainment are the least concentrated, interestingly- the massive numbers of applications in the category create fragmentation of the popularity.

    "text": "I‚Äôm more than a month into my conversion to a Mac, and so far I‚Äôve adjusted nicely. The largest issue for me was the fact that I didn‚Äôt know any shortcut keys, so I was using the mouse a lot more than I‚Äôm used to. I‚Äôm overcoming that, though I desparately miss ctrl+tab to switch between windows of the current application.\nThere are two applications that I haven‚Äôt been able to give up in my transition, however.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúApplication #1 is Zune. Yeah, I said it. I‚Äôm not being a MS fanboy- Zune is a truly great application (the interface is far superior to iTunes, really not even comparable), but it also has subscription music, which is a huge money saver for me (I waste a lot less money buying music that I end up getting sick of or not liking at all). So enjoy the rich irony of Zune running on my MacBook Pro, and my horrible brown Zune docked to the awesomely great looking laptop.‚Äù\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nThe second application is, of course, Windows Live Writer. I actually spent the first week or so on the Mac without installing Writer, and it was just too painful. Trying to use the web interface was a complete non starter, and there was simply no comparison between other editors out there (ok, now I‚Äôm being biased). A quick VMWare and Windows XP install later and I‚Äôm running Writer on my Mac, using Unity to create a first class experience.\n\n\nThe transition was really smoothed by the addition of VMware- anytime I need to I can simply open up Windows and do what I need to do (I ended up installing Visual Studio there so I can whip up quick utility apps in C#, for example). to any windows users getting ready to make the jump, I can definitely give you two pieces of advice from my experience:\nThe Mac experience is sweet. The OS is nice, the hardware and software are beautiful, and everything does really just work. I‚Äôd recommend it. Invest in VMWare Fusion. For the small additional cost of of a VMware license, you can keep your Windows apps around, and have a fall back plan in case you need to do something that just requires Windows."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Everyone who has spent some time on the App Store realizes that there are a large number of pointless or even harmful comments. Whether the post simply says ‚Äòfirst‚Äô, disses an application that the commenter has never used, or complains about an issue that was fixed in an updated version of the app, the comment system on the App Store isn‚Äôt adequate. It‚Äôs a rough situation since the App Store doesn‚Äôt allow trialing of apps. Comments, the application description, and the application screenshots are the only real way for an end user to assess an application, so filling 1/3 of the assessment with garbage really hurts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome see this as a place where Apple should exert more control, perhaps even filtering the comments. What grand irony that the same people that complain when Apple filter apps call for Apple to filter comments! Here‚Äôs a couple of suggestions that would go a long ways to improving the commenting, but don‚Äôt require Apple to be a gatekeeper.\n\nAllow users to rate comments. Comments that are pointless and crappy will simply be voted down (a la Slashdot, Digg, Reddit, Amazon.com reviews, and a million other examples). Use filtering to only display the low rated comments if the viewer requests it.\n\nEdit: Hey- they already allow this, and it looks to be working pretty well. Some of the apps I looked at had pretty reasonable reviews with very little noise, just from this filter alone. Nice.\n\nAllow a single developer post to appear at or near the top of the comments. This developer post can be updated when the developer publishes a new version of their product. They can use it to explain what issues (that appear in the comments) they have addressed in the current release. A lot of developers are doing this in the application description, and it‚Äôs annoying to see a bunch of text responding to comments where there should just be text describing the application.\nFilter on whether the commenter has ‚Äòbought‚Äô the app. Since iTunes knows what Apps the user has, why not just add a simple icon to comments from folks who have actually downloaded the app, and default a filter to only show comments by people who have downloaded the app. This adds friction to the pointless commenters and will help improve the quality of comments that display.\n\nWhatever happens, how about we trend away from gatekeepers in the App Store?"

    "title": "Hope for Expensive Apps iTunes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the challenges that has faced developers of apps on the iTunes App Store has been how to price their applications. Early customers complained about applications with high (read: more than $9.99) prices. Since those early days, a competitive and crowded field of applications has conspired to push prices down as consumers faced more choices and application sought to claim a stop on the coveted ‚ÄòTop 25‚Äô list.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple really made things a challenge, largely because they have such a limited business model for these applications (a 1 time license fee, no subscription model, no charged upgrade model, no trial model). Developer‚Äôs hands were really tied.\nA smart developer would be better served to build a large number of small inexpensive applications (collecting revenue from customers each time they release a new application) rather than spend a large amount of time on complicated apps. After all, a lots of users will plunk down $1.99 for an app based only on screen shots and reviews, but most are loathe to part with $29.99 on just the promise of a good app.\nSo it came to be that the app store has been crowded, at least in my opinion, with a ton of apps that are a lot closer to gadgets than applications. Useful, sure. Valuable, maybe. An inspired use of what is an excellent mobile computing platform? Definitely not.\nBut just today, I‚Äôve seen a couple of apps that are bucking the trend.\nBeeJiveIM is a deep IM client for the iPhone that supports pretty much every IM platform out there. It uses push email to do notification of new messages. It has a broad and deep feature set. And, it costs $15.99. Jaadu VNC is a VNC client which allows you to connect to and control your desktop computer (whether that is a Mac or PC). Broad and deep feature set. $24.99. Now, we just to need to wait and see how the economics play out. Can these more complicated and expensive applications thrive at a high price, in a market with so many limitations? Will Apple continue to invest in improving iTunes for applications, adding some of the basic business models that software companies have traditionally used in selling their software?\nIf you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôd like to see expensive iPhone applications, the answer is pretty simple. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôd like to see awesome, compelling, deep, feature rich, and evolving applications the iPhone. And I‚Äôd like to see the developers who build getting paid a fair price."

After living and working here for 10 years prior to my time at Microsoft, it feels great to be back. Just in time for the MLB playoffs too. I had a great time working at Microsoft, a career objective of mine from way back has now been checked off the list :).\nIf you‚Äôre in the Boston area and I haven‚Äôt yet reached out to offer to buy you a cup of coffee and chat, please drop me a line!"

After digging around on the net for some up to date analysis, I gave up and decided I‚Äôd do some analysis myself. (Most of the analysis, including my own previous analysis, only uses the top applications, which are available in an RSS feed. But that creates bias, since the analysis is exclusively based upon successful applications).\nAfter a little expedition to gather some data (I admit it, I used .Net rather than a more fashionable scripting language), I now have an easily updateable spreadsheet with all of the apps in the app store.\nThere were some surprises."

It‚Äôs an incredible trend that currently isn‚Äôt showing any sings of leveling off.\n\nNote the huge spike around the street availability date of the 2nd generation iPhone- developers are rushing to get their app in the store in time for the launch (only to be disappointed when the approval process was opaque and sluggish). Apple has clearly worked to scale their review process since their normal days are approaching that initial spike that overwhelmed the review process around the launch.\nIf you have a look at the cumulative chart, you can see the same thing- little to no drop off in the volume of applications‚Ä¶"

Note that there are more $.99 applications than free applications.\n\n\nWhen you look at the average price in each category, it‚Äôs not surprising to see serious application categories like Business, Healthcare, and Finance have the highest average price. Also not that surprising to see entertainment oriented categories with the lowest average prices. This follows the vitamin versus pain killer theory- people pay more for pain killers than for vitamins.\n\nA related point to consider- free applications are¬†a lot¬†more popular than paid applications. Since we don‚Äôt know how the popularity score is calculated, it‚Äôs a bit difficult to figure out what to make of this, other than to point out the obvious- people are willing to try free stuff."

Applications, include that data as well, with values ranging from 0 to 1.

    "title": "The App Store Model Business Model: Lite",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Since the beginning, figuring out the right way to monetize applications in the App Store has been confusing. Not only was the marketplace completely new and unlike any other software marketplace, but the App Store still itself was¬†incredibly limiting. In addition, the price for applications¬†trended downward¬†while alternatives like advertising entered the market. The net of it was a lot of experimentation regarding how to make money on applications.\n\nBusiness Model Emerging\nOver the last couple of months, I believe that a business model for paid applications is starting to emerge. Not surprisingly, it looks a lot like the business model that licensed software businesses have been using for a long time (turns out that all those folks had figured something out). That model? Trial versions with paid full versions.\nThe App Store doesn‚Äôt have explicit support for this, unfortunately, but application developers are working around this by introducing ‚ÄòLite‚Äô versions of their applications. Not only are there¬†success stories¬†out there, but the submissions to the store show the increasing popularity of these ‚ÄòLite‚Äô applications. In fact, there are now nearly 1,000 ‚ÄòLite‚Äô applications the App Store, representing about 5% of the total applications.\nLooking at the categories, one other very striking thing appears. Application categories that tend to have longer term recurring value (like Games, Business, Finance, Photography, and Productivity) appear to also have the most ‚ÄòLite‚Äô versions.\n\n\n\n\nIn some categories, the growth is even more pronounced. For example, in the category of Games, 14% of the applications are ‚ÄòLite‚Äô applications!\n\nBut the real evidence of the growing popularity of ‚ÄòLite‚Äô applications (at least among developers submitting applications) is that each month, a growing proportion of the new apps are ‚ÄòLite.‚Äô In February so far, 7% of the new applications are ‚ÄòLite‚Äô applications! And the downward trend of free apps continue as more ‚ÄòLite‚Äô apps hit the store.\n\n\n\n\nThe Paid Upgrade Problem\nSo I have to admit it, as a real fan of the App Store and the iPhone, I‚Äôm excited to see a business model developing, especially one that may help improve developer‚Äôs ability to collect value for their hard work. And while trial versions are a first step, they are only a first step. For though they let users try a new version before buying, and therefore should allow developers to raise their prices, they still permit developers to collect payment for their work only once.\nThis is a problem mainly because in traditional licensed software, developers keep working on their application, improving it across a number of different versions. And at the companies that I‚Äôve worked for, the (about) yearly upgrades were a¬†big¬†driver of yearly revenue. Without the upgrade revenue, a rational developer should really wonder whether their time spent improving an existing product will really net more users, or whether they should instead spend their time building a new application that they can monetize.\nSo while ‚ÄòLite‚Äô should help reward developers who create a deep and rich application experience for their users, I‚Äôm not sure it goes far enough. To support ongoing development of these deep applications, Apple needs to do more.\n\n\nWhat Should Apple Do?\nWhat should Apple do? I think there are a few things that would go a long ways:\n\nThe most obvious thing that Apple should do is¬† provide the concept of trial versions right in the App Store. By providing the infrastructure and user experience around this, they can ‚Äòinstitutionalize‚Äô the concept of trial software, making it a common and well accepting model. They can also save developers the time of having to create and maintain two applications in the store.\nBut Apple also needs to address the upgrade problem. Apple could allow paid upgrades, but this actually ends up being a real mess since it creates a complicated set of versioning issues (for example, once a paid upgrade has been created, do bugs still get fixed in the old version?).\nApple could also enable the concept of ‚Äòsubscriptions‚Äô to software, enabling developers to charge something like $.99/month, making it possible to collect longer term revenue for highly valuable applications.\n\nIt seems clear that enabling trialing natively is a no brainer for the App Store. Will Apple step up? And could they surprise us by doing even more? We‚Äôll have to wait and see, the App Store remains a young marketplace and each month we all learn something new.\n[CSV file of supporting data]"

    "text": "One of the things I‚Äôve been maintaining on the Quarto team is the GitHub actions that build installers, run tests, and so on. A few times over the last year, we‚Äôve run into problems in our pipeline which didn‚Äôt appear as explicit failures, but instead showed up as significant changes in the duration of tasks or actions. For example, there was a stretch where Deno bundling was facing challeges, and this initially appeared to us as very slow bundling as a part of building the installer for Quarto.\nOf course, since we didn‚Äôt typically build installers locally, it took a while for me to notice that building an installer had become very slow on the CI machines. This got me thinking about the need to have more systematic analytics about key elements of the CI pipeline. It would be great to be able to see a commit by commit (or PR by PR) graph of the bundle time, making it easy to pinpoint a code change that contributed to a change in behavior (for example, us updating to a new version of Deno).\nI looked around for a simple service that would allow me to poke a custom event into a time series and then provided nice visualization tools for this. I even thought perhaps something would already be dialed for GH actions, but I didn‚Äôt find anything (tell me if you know of one!).\n\nI ultimately rigged up a duct tape version of this using Amplitude and their command line API via GitHub action. This allows me to see how long it takes to bundle Quarto and track that over time.\nI also add a more explicit performance check. This means that we can see how our render performance changes over time and whether there are changes along the way that drive outsized changes in render performance- largely as a prompt to go look more deeply (I realize that this isn‚Äôt exactly a scientifically reproducible performance benchmark).\nIt strikes me that there is a nice opportunity for someone to build out infrastructure that allows the tracking of metrics such as this, which nicely integrates with GH actions (perhaps even tracking some metrics about GH action performance with little to no configuration). Seems like a service that could be of benefit to a lot of developers!"

This release was a longer cycle, taking just over 9 months and encompassing a number of pretty significant improvements to Quarto. You can learn more about what is new in this release on the [Quarto Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2024-01-24-1.4-release/).

### Issues and Release Length

Historically, Quarto releases have actually been relatively short, on the order of 3-5 months. This release took as us much longer than usual. In exchange for all that time, however, we made a significant dent in our issues, fixing more than **700** issues.

| Release | Days | Issues Closed | Closed / Day |
|---------|------|---------------|--------------|
| **1.0** | 518  | 60            | 0.12         |
| **1.1** | 65   | 86            | 1.32         |
| **1.2** | 75   | 159           | 2.12         |
| **1.3** | 169  | 401           | 2.37         |
| **1.4** | 273  | 713           | 2.61         |

: Days between releases {#tbl-days .striped}

It isn't clear that we can sustain this level of issue closing, but we're just a few days into Quarto 1.5 pre-release builds and so far we're exceeding that 2.61 / day rate. I think we obviously won't sustain that but in the meantime üçª.

I'm currently working as a Technology and Security Policy Fellow at the RAND Corporation. I spend my time as a contributor to the [Inspect AI](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk) platform and conducting safety research and evaluations of large language models. 

Prior to joining RAND, I was a Software Architect at [Posit](https://www.posit.co) where helped developed [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org), a popular technical and scientific computing platform. 

Prior to joining Posit, I was the founder, CEO, and Chairman of FitNow, Inc., the maker of [Lose It!](https://www.loseit.com), one of the most popular health and fitness application for iOS and Android devices. Since 2008, tens of millions of users have used Lose It! to lose more than 100 million pounds. Lose It! was acquired by the [Everyday Health Group](https://www.everydayhealthgroup.com) in 2021.

Before that I spend some time as a Technologist in Residence at [General Catalyst Partners](https://www.generalcatalyst.com) where I focused on Smartphone and Cloud Computing technologies. Before joining General Catalyst, I was a co-founder of Onfolio, Inc., which was acquired by Microsoft in 2005. At [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) I worked overseeing the development and engineering of [Windows Live Writer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/open-live-writer) which was originally created at Onfolio, Inc.

My very first post-collegiate professional experience was working as the first employee at [Allaire Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allaire_Corporation), which was acquired by [Macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia) in 2001. At Macromedia, I was a Director of Engineering responsible for the development and engineering of [ColdFusion](https://coldfusion.adobe.com) (now Adobe ColdFusion). 

I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu).

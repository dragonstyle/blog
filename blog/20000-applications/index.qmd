Ok, there are now more than 20,000 applications in the App Store. Amazing.

And to give you a bit of perspective, it took 155 days to get the first 5,000 application. Getting from 15,000 to 20,000 took just 23 days. Getting from 20,000 to 25,000 will now take less than 20. The continued growth, especially now that we're past the holidays really is staggering.
